# Priority-Queue-Problem
The priority queue is mainly based on the logic of how a printer works or how the work is done in a photocopy shop.  In the insertion part, the program takes two inputs time and money. The first input of work and money remains as it is. Cause its already on process but the other inputs are sorted here based on their priority. First we are considering the work time and then its money. The smallest work will always get higher priority. But if time is same and the money is higher, then that work will have higher priority than others. In case of deletion, it will be one after another based on their priority.
